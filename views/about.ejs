                    social-media. Currently I reside in Uttrakhand, India</h1>

                <p>
                    Hello everyone I am Jashan Pratap Singh a student of R.A.N. Public School. I am 16 years old and currently, I am studying 11th standard. This section includes all about my behaviour and what I aspire to be. In this section, I will be particularly talking
                    about my inner self. This section includes my hobbies, interests, talent, passions, strengths, weaknesses and life goals. I am sure that you will find this section interesting if you complete it!
                </p>

                <p> I have a very wide-ranging list of hobbies and the reason behind this is that I procrastinate a lot while doing a different kind of stuff. So to find the reason behind this procrastination I always switch my hobbies or add a new hobby
                    to my list and this is because I believe that if you are procrastinating or are not able to give your 100% in activity then that interest or hobby might not be the best option for you! In the course of the past three years, I have
                    shown interest in every possible activity that was done by people in my locality and it includes playing instruments, singing, dancing, art & craft, photography, running a podcast, making social media pages, playing sports, debating,
                    giving speeches, organizing events, taking part in MUN's, editing cinematic videos, making websites and apps etc. Now this is a long list, isn't it But for the past year or so I have stopped procrastinating from a hobby or two and
                    that are "Making real-world solutions or innovations" and "Photography". These two hobbies have helped me to grow as a human being and a student. I figured out that these hobbies were the source of the best learnings that I have ever
                    had. I was able to learn a lot faster than other people in these hobbies and the efforts that I gave for these activities felt minimal because of my interest and passion that I had for these hobbies! So now I would like to show the
                    individual pieces of work that I have done for these activities!
                </p>

                <p> I think my biggest strength is to be able to make progress a lot faster than other people. Ever since I have joined this school I have shown tremendous progress which has set me apart from other students in the school. According to my
                    experience, the person making progress is a lot better than the people how are ahead of him and are still aren't making progress because eventually, the ones who are making progress are going to surpass them. The other quality or strength
                    that I see in myself is that I am able to connect with people easily. I am able to build up teams and groups and get the best out of the people that I work with and I think this is because of the fact that I always help out people
                    with their day to day work and never betray them.
